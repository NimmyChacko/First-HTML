<h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard mark up language that web browsers use to interpret and  compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages.It is used to give structure to a web page. 
<h3>Mark up</h3>
<div></div>
<p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called <strong>tags</strong> (and their <strong>attributes</strong>), character-based data types, character references and entity references.The first tag in such a pair is the <em>start tag</em>, and the second is the <em>end tag</em> (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
</div>
Some examples of tags are:<br/>
<ul><li>h1 to h6 – headings(large font to small)</li>	
<li>p  – paragraph</li>	
<li>br – break</li>
<li>em – emphasis(italics)</li>
<li>ol – ordered list</li>
<li>ul – unordered list</li>
<li>strong or b(old version) – bold</li>
<li>img – image</li></ul>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>HTML attributes are a modifier of a HTML element type. 
Some examples are:
<ol style type="A">
<li>scr – source</li>
<li>width</li>
<li>height</li>
<li>alt – alternate</li>
</ol></p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>Syntax is the arrangement of elements and attributes to create well-formed documents.(like correct grammar in a language).<br/>
<strong>Semantic HTML</strong>, also known as semantic markup, refers to the use of HTML tags that convey the meaning—or semantics—of the content contained within them.</p>
